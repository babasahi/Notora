# BacNote



## The idea behing BacNote

when i was a high school senior i used all the time to take my calculator(or the calculator in my phone) and
try to predict my note in the final exam.
it was slightly complex calculation because you have to get all subjects's individual notes and adds them all together 
and then divide the sum by 32.
This application simplifies the whole thing in easy and beatifull.
