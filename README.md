# üßê Project philosophy

When i was a high school senior i used all the time to take my calculator(or the calculator in my phone) and
try to predict my note in the final exam.
it was slightly complex calculation because you have to get all subjects's individual notes and adds them all together
and then divide the sum by 32.
This application simplifies the whole thing in easy and beatifull.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Notora app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Shared Prefrences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package which allows the app to read and write simple key-value pairs. Wraps NSUserDefaults on iOS and SharedPreferences on Android.
- The app uses the font ["UbuntuMono"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
